LIVE Arch Linux with XFCE
===========================

An Arch Linux iso that uses a live XFCE environment.  It is intended as an installation environment that is more comfortable than just a tty.  Comes with full Networking and a browser to read the wiki.

Current features include:
- XFCE 4.10
- Firefox
- gparted
- Network Manager
- dhcpcd with wifi-menu for cases where Network Manager does not work properly
- Yaourt
- Broadcom Wireless Drivers
- Leafpad Text Editor


Information:
--------------

To Download the iso, run the downloadiso.sh file in the master folder.  It does not require root permissions.


Default username: livearch
Default password: guest

To start live XFCE environment, run:
	<pre><code>startxfce4</code></pre>
after logging into livearch.

To-Do List:
-------------

1. Work on adding more live tools
2. Update the iso each month
3. Work on having LXDM start at boot, instead of having to run "startxfce4"
